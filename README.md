Highly apreciated if using this because me here to self-distinguish.

Include in footer(include function of PHP on providing those 2 variables) after you logged in $_REQUEST[$sess_name] and $_COOKIE[$sess_name] to check server side.< ? php ob_flush(); header("Location : ".$url(absolute starting / is documentroot, ../ parent directory, ./ the directory itself  or relative)); exit(); ? > without generating before output to redirect to index to log in,destroying the output ob_flush();

< ? php .... ? > processing instruction,< ? = .... ? > the same as echo

~Equivalent to session.use_trans_sid = 1 in php.ini(use even .user.ini in directory files) this to secure your site and ajaxes with $sess_name = 'SESSION' and $cookie='A VALUE' IF YOU USE $_SESSION YOU NEED session_write_close VERY FAST.LoadModule access_compat_module modules/mod_access_compat.so in httpd.conf to enable .htaccess which a bit of legacy
